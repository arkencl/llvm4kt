# LLVM4KT

## Getting Started

There were no decent options to utilize the LLVM from JVM. This subtree contains modern Kotlin bindings to the LLVM.

LLVM4KT aims to cover most of the LLVM-C API. This is made possible using the [generated LLVM bindings for Java](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/tree/master/llvm).
